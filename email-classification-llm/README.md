# LLM Email Classifier (Jupyter Notebook)

This project, completed as part of a **DataCamp Real World Projects**, demonstrates how to build an intelligent email assistant using a **local Large Language Model (LLM)**, specifically **Llama**, for **email classification**. It focuses on **prompt engineering** and basic model integration to categorize emails into predefined labels, aiming to improve inbox efficiency.

---

## Project Overview

This Jupyter Notebook project is a hands-on exploration of using local LLMs for automated email categorization. It showcases the core concepts of prompt engineering and LLM interaction, serving as a foundational demonstration rather than a deployable application.

---

## Features

* **Email Classification:** Categorize example email content (Priority, Updates, Promotion).
* **Local LLM Integration:** Shows how to load and use a Llama LLM directly from your machine.
* **Prompt Engineering Focus:** Highlights techniques for crafting effective prompts to guide the LLM's classification.

---

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

* Python 3.x
* Jupyter Notebook (`pip install notebook`)
* Sufficient disk space for Llama model weights.

### Installation & Run

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/lahiruC22/data-science-projects.git
    cd data-science-projects/email-classification-llm
    ```
2.  **Open Notebook:** Start Jupyter (`jupyter notebook`) and open `email_classifier_notebook.ipynb`.
3.  **Run Cells:** Execute cells sequentially to see the classification in action.

## Future Work

Potential next steps include integrating with email APIs, building a user interface, and enabling user-defined categories.
