## Overview
The project demonstrates the following key data analysis concepts:
- Data cleaning and preparation
- Exploratory data analysis (EDA)
- Data visualization using libraries like Matplotlib and Seaborn

The goal is to derive insights from the medical dataset and visually represent key health metrics.

## Features
- Cleans and preprocesses a dataset related to cardiovascular health.
- Computes various health metrics, such as BMI.
- Generates informative visualizations, including:
  - Categorical plot comparisons.
  - Heatmaps showing correlations between variables.

## Installation
